A micropig wearing a tiny raincoat and booties.
Dying of dysentery.
My inner demons.
A can of whoop-ass.
The inevitable heat death of the universe.
The violation of our most basic human rights.
Funky fresh rhymes.
Licking things to claim them as your own.
The heart of a child.
Puppies!
Bees?
A ball of earwax, semen, and toenail clippings.
Hobos.
A mopey zoo lion.
A bag of magic beans.
An icepick lobotomy.
Free samples.
Active listening.
A lifetime of sadness.
Immaculate conception.
My genitals.
Science.
Flightless birds.
Doing the right thing.
The invisible hand.
My relationship status.
A pyramid of severed heads.
Some god-damn peace and quiet.
A zesty breakfast burrito.
Switching to GeicoÂ®.
Aaron Burr.
An ugly face.
A windmill full of corpses.
The true meaning of Christmas.
Estrogen.
A good sniff.
A foul mouth.
The hiccups.
The patriarchy.
A sad fat dragon with no friends.
A bunch of idiots playing a card game instead of interacting like normal humans.
A squadron of moles wearing aviator goggles.
The inevitable heat death of the universe.
The miracle of childbirth.
A moment of silence.
The American Dream.
A can of whoop-ass.
The blood of Christ.
An honest cop with nothing left to lose.
Firing a rifle into the air while balls deep in a squealing hog.
